  title = {A Psychometric Network Perspective on the Measurement and Assessment of Personality Traits},
  url = {https://osf.io/ktejp},
  doi = {10.31234/osf.io/ktejp},
  abstract = {Nearly all personality measurement and assessment has been shaped by traditional psychometric methods such as classical test theory. Despite advances in personality theory and psychometrics, most personality assessment instruments were developed using traditional psychometric concepts and measures. In recent years, a new field of network psychometrics has emerged, which embraces the inherent complexity of personality and promises to change the way researchers think about psychological constructs. With this new tool comes the opportunity to refine and advance measurement and assessment practices, particularly in personality research. In this paper, we briefly review modern personality theories and discuss how psychometric network models can inform their conjectures. After, we review trends in personality measurement and show how psychometric networks complement these movements. Then, we put forward a psychometric network framework for developing personality assessment instruments. Within this framework, we connect network measures to traditional psychometric measures and provide guidelines for how psychometric networks can be used to develop personality scales. We argue that psychometric networks allow better control over the construct being measured, providing greater specificity in the assessment of psychological attributes. Several future directions emphasizing the development and improvement of this framework are provided.},

  abstract = {This chapter provides a general introduction of network modeling in psychometrics. The chapter starts with an introduction to the statistical model formulation of pairwise Markov random fields (PMRF), followed by an introduction of the PMRF suitable for binary data: the Ising model. The Ising model is a model used in ferromagnetism to explain phase transitions in a field of particles. Following the description of the Ising model in statistical physics, the chapter continues to show that the Ising model is closely related to models used in psychometrics. The Ising model can be shown to be equivalent to certain kinds of logistic regression models, loglinear models and multi-dimensional item response theory (MIRT) models. The equivalence between the Ising model and the MIRT model puts standard psychometrics in a new light and leads to a strikingly different interpretation of well-known latent variable models. The chapter gives an overview of methods that can be used to estimate the Ising model, and concludes with a discussion on the interpretation of latent variables given the equivalence between the Ising model and MIRT.},

  abstract = {Pairwise network models such as the Gaussian Graphical Model (GGM) are a powerful and intuitive way to analyze dependencies in multivariate data. A key assumption of the GGM is that each pairwise interaction is independent of the values of all other variables. However, in psychological research this is often implausible. In this paper, we extend the GGM by allowing each pairwise interaction between two variables to be moderated by (a subset of) all other variables in the model, and thereby introduce a Moderated Network Model (MNM). We show how to construct the MNM and propose an L1-regularized nodewise regression approach to estimate it. We provide performance results in a simulation study and show that MNMs outperform the split-sample based methods Network Comparison Test (NCT) and Fused Graphical Lasso (FGL) in detecting moderation effects. Finally, we provide a fully reproducible tutorial on how to estimate MNMs with the R-package mgm and discuss possible issues with model misspecification.},

  abstract = {Gaussian graphical models (GGM) allow for learning conditional independence structures that are encoded by partial correlations. Whereas there are several \textbackslash{}proglang\{R\} packages for classical (i.e., frequentist) methods, there are only two that implement a Bayesian approach. These are exclusively focused on identifying the graphical structure; that is, detecting non-zero effects.  The \textbackslash{}proglang\{R\} package \textbackslash{}pkg\{BGGM\} not only fills this gap, but it also includes novel Bayesian methodology for extending inference beyond identifying non-zero relations. \textbackslash{}pkg\{BGGM\} is built around two Bayesian approaches for inference--estimation and hypothesis testing. The former focuses on the posterior distribution and includes extensions to assess predictability, as well as methodology to compare partial correlations. The latter includes methods for Bayesian hypothesis testing, in both exploratory and confirmatory contexts, with the novel matrix-\$F\$ prior distribution. This allows for testing order and equality constrained hypotheses, as well as a combination of both with the Bayes factor. Further, there are two approaches for comparing any number of GGMs with either the posterior predictive distribution or Bayesian hypothesis testing. This work describes the software implementation of these methods. We end by discussing future directions for \textbackslash{}pkg\{BGGM\}.},
